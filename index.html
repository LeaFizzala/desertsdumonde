        <p>"Hagrid, it's us!" Harry shouted, pounding on the door. "Open up!" Hagrid didn't answer. 
            They could hear Fang scratching at the door, whining, but it didn't open. 
            They hammered on it for ten more minutes; Ron even went and banged on one of the windows, 
            but there was no response. "What's he avoiding us for?" 
            Hermione said when they had finally given up and were walking back to the school. 
            "He surely doesn't think we'd care about him being half-giant?" 
            But it seemed that Hagrid did care. They didn't see a sign of him all week. 
            He didn't appear at the staff table at mealtimes, they didn't see him going about his gamekeeper 
            duties on the grounds, and Professor Grubbly-Plank continued to take the Care of Magical Creatures
             classes. Malfoy was gloating at every possible opportunity. 
             "Missing your half-breed pal?" he kept whispering to Harry whenever there was a teacher around,
              so that he was safe from Harry's retaliation. "Missing the elephant-man?" 
              There was a Hogsmeade visit halfway through January. 
              Hermione was very surprised that Harry was going to go. 
              "I just thought you'd want to take advantage of the common room being quiet," she said. 
              "Really get to work on that egg." "Oh I - I reckon I've got a pretty good idea what it's about now," Harry lied. "Have you really?" said Hermione, looking impressed.
               "Well done!" Harrys insides gave a guilty squirm, but he ignored them. 
               He still had five weeks to work out that egg clue, after all, and that was ages. . . 
               whereas if he went into Hogsmeade, he might run into Hagrid, and get a chance to persuade 
               him to come back.</p>
